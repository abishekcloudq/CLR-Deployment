> There are three key constructs related to data in Salesforce: ==**objects, fields,**== and **==records==. ==Objects==** are similar to tables in databases. **==Fields==** are similar to columns of the table. **==Records==** are similar to rows of data inside the table. Salesforce uses object-level, field-level, and record-level security to secure access to object, field, and individual records.

## Object-level-security

> [!NOTE] Important
> Before allowing a user access, Salesforce first verifies that the ==user has permissions== to see objects of that type. Object-level access can be managed through two configurations, ==profiles== and ==permission sets==.
